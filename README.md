Dear AirTM Support Team,

My name is Gazi Shaplur Rahman, and my AirTM account is registered under the email address gazirakib400@gmail.com. I am a fully verified user and have been actively utilizing AirTM as my primary platform to receive legitimate freelance payments in USD.

I am currently engaged as a remote freelancer with Outlier.ai, and my earnings are disbursed on a weekly basis via Scale AI, Inc. AirTM has played a vital role in managing these international payments efficiently and securely.

To date, my account's lifetime transaction volume has reached approximately $10,000, and I understand that my current inflow/outflow limit is set at $25,000. Given my ongoing and consistent use of the platform for verifiable income, I am writing to formally request Enhanced Verification in order to remove this transaction cap and continue operating without limitations.

In support of my request, I have attached the following documents:

A copy of my valid passport as proof of identity

Screenshots of my Outlier.ai account and payout history via Scale AI, Inc.

A recent bank statement as proof of address

I kindly request that you review my application and consider increasing my transaction limits. Should you require any additional information or documentation, I am more than willing to provide it at your convenience.

Thank you for your time and support. I look forward to your positive response and to continuing my professional use of AirTM.

Sincerely,
Gazi Shaplur Rahman
