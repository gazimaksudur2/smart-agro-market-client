# Password Change Feature

## Overview
Added password change functionality to the Profile page that allows users to securely update their passwords for both Firebase authentication and the database.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. AuthContext Updates (`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
- Added Firebase imports: `updatePassword`, `reauthenticateWithCredential`, `EmailAuthProvider`
- Implemented `changePassword` function that:
  - Re-authenticates user with current password
  - Updates password in Firebase
  - Updates password in database via API call
  - Provides proper error handling and user feedback

#### 2. Profile Component Updates (`src/components/Dashboard/pages/Profile.jsx`)
- Added new state management for password form
- Added password visibility toggle functionality
- Added comprehensive form validation
- Added new Security Settings section with:
  - Current password field
  - New password field
  - Confirm password field
  - Password requirements display
  - Toggle password visibility buttons
  - Loading states and proper error handling

### Features

#### Security Features
- **Re-authentication Required**: Users must enter their current password before changing it
- **Password Validation**: 
  - Minimum 6 characters
  - New password must be different from current
  - Password confirmation must match
- **Dual Update**: Updates both Firebase and database passwords
- **Error Handling**: Specific error messages for different scenarios

#### User Experience Features
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Eye icons to show/hide passwords
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during password update
- **Form Reset**: Clears form after successful update
- **Validation Messages**: Clear feedback for validation errors
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes

### API Integration
The feature expects a backend endpoint:
```
PATCH /users/{email}/password
Body: { newPassword: "new_password_here" }
```

### Error Handling
Handles specific Firebase errors:
- `auth/wrong-password`: Current password is incorrect
- `auth/weak-password`: New password is too weak
- `auth/requires-recent-login`: User needs to re-authenticate

### Usage
1. Navigate to Profile page in dashboard
2. Scroll to Security Settings section
3. Click "Change Password" button
4. Fill in current password and new password
5. Confirm new password
6. Click "Update Password"

### Security Considerations
- Requires current password verification
- Updates both Firebase and database
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
- Form data is cleared after submission
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions

## Files Modified
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Added changePassword function
- `src/components/Dashboard/pages/Profile.jsx` - Added password change UI and logic

## Testing
To test the feature:
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Profile
3. Try changing password with various scenarios:
   - Correct current password
   - Wrong current password
   - Weak new password
   - Mismatched confirmation
   - Same old and new password

The feature includes comprehensive validation and error handling for all scenarios.
